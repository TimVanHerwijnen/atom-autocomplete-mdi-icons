## Features

- Shows icon previews alongside suggestions
- Supports MDI version 5.4.55
- Includes one HTML snippet for vuetify since I desperately wanted it :)
- ~~Also searches aliases so icons are easier to find~~ Too many icons to give aliases, so I didn't add any. MAYBE i'll add them in the future
- Displays the unicode value for each icon
- Provides links to documentation for each Font Awesome icon

## Installation

Go into Atom's Settings/Preferences &gt; Install &gt; search for `autocomplete-font-awesome`
