# atom-autocomplete-mdi-icons

Material Design Icons autocomplete and icon previews for Atom.

### Forked from [lonecorean](https://github.com/lonekorean)'s [atom-autocomplete-font-awesome](https://github.com/lonekorean/atom-autocomplete-font-awesome)
(He basically made an awesome icon autocomplete/preview framwork)


## Demo

## Features

- No conflicts with atom-autocomplete-font-awesome
- Shows icon previews alongside suggestions
- Supports MDI version 5.4.55
- Includes one HTML snippet for vuetify since I desperately wanted it :)
- ~~Also searches aliases so icons are easier to find~~ Too many icons to give aliases, so I didn't add any. MAYBE i'll add them in the future
- Displays the unicode value for each icon
- Provides links to documentation for each Font Awesome icon

## Installation

I'm not planning on publishing it unless the will be a great demand for it

So you must install it by command line:

```
apm install https://github.com/TimVanHerwijnen/atom-autocomplete-mdi-icons
```
